The libavcodec.dll shipped with DGAVCDec is a GPL binary. I built it from the
source code available here:

http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?groupname=ffdshow-tryout

I have made a small modification to return a different version string to
manage compatibility issues. This modification is available on request.
