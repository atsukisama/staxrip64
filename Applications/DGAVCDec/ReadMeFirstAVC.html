<center><h2>DGAVCDec Release Notes</h2>

***Version 1.0.9***</center>
<p><hr><p>
Version 1.0.9 changes:
<p>
1. Fix a bug in backward GOP stepping.
<p>
2. Fixed a problem with Load Project.
<p>
3. Added option "Display HD Full Sized".
<p>
4. Fixed a problem in M2TS file parsing.
<p><hr><p>
DGAVCIndex produces an index file named *.dga. The Avisynth script
looks like this:
<p>
<tt>loadplugin("DGAVCDecode.dll")<br>
AVCSource("file.dga")
</tt>
<p>
You can also disable deblocking:
<p>
<tt>
AVCSource("file.dga",deblock=false)
</tt>
<p>
Note that the included decoder DLL (libavcodec.dll) must be
in the same directory as the DGAVCIndex executable.
<p>
<b>WARNING</b>: You have to update the DLL mentioned above for each new release! DO NOT ASSUME
THAT IT IS NOT CHANGED EVEN IF HAS THE SAME FILENAME.
<p><hr><p>
<h3>Current Limitations</h3
<p>
1. Only AVC/H.264 elementary (raw) and transport streams can be opened (no MKV or MP4 files yet).
Only one file can be opened at a time.
<p>
2. Fast random access requires frequent IDR frames, I frames, or recovery point SEIs.
<p>
3. DGAVCDec uses libavcodec.dll, so if that library cannot handle a stream properly, then
DGAVCDec also will not handle it properly. The popular VLC player also uses the same code, so
you can test your stream there to see if any problem encountered is due to libavcodec.dll or to
DGAVCDec. The reality is that, as of today, libavcodec.dll has problems with several types
of streams, and we will have to wait for it to become more mature.
<p>
4. Data partitioning is not yet supported.
